                                            <p>I’ve spent the last <strong>15 years working in accounts payable.</strong> I was recently offered a management role. Call me naïve, but I never realized supervising the performance of others could be so stressful. Adding to that, I spent hours a day at my desk, hunched over my screen, staring at numbers all week, <strong>even staying overtime during the busy season.</strong></p>
                                            <p>Four years ago, my wife and I had our first child. To this day, that little rascal keeps us on our toes. And the next one is due to arrive in a few months.</p>
                                            <p>About two years ago, I accidentally stumbled into doing some <strong>bookkeeping work as an enjoyable little side gig.</strong> A buddy started up his own craft brewing business and I wanted to make sure he did things properly. Word got around, and I ended up getting a few more clients out of it. It was nice having a bit of extra cash coming in. And what can I say, I like free beer.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Unfortunately, the stress of balancing everything started to creep up on me.</strong></p>

                                            <p>Suddenly I was waking up feeling <strong>headachy and sore.</strong> Computer work was becoming a hardship. <strong>My neck and back were always killing me.</strong></p>
                                            <p>I went and saw a doctor hoping he could explain what was causing the crick in my neck. He told me it could be a bunch of things.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Not exactly helpful.</strong></p>
                                            <p>He prescribed some pills for the muscle spasms which helped a little, but I never did shake all the symptoms I was experiencing.</p>
                                            <p>My wife suggested I get a massage, but the idea of <strong>someone I didn’t know rubbing my neck didn’t really appeal.</strong> The same thing goes for having a chiropractor go to town on my neck and spine.</p>
                                            <p><img src="images/img3.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid b-loaded"></p>
                                            <p>I even tried one of those <strong>vibrating back massagers, but it was more of a distraction than a fix.</strong></p>
                                            <p><strong>When your neck is sore, everything suffers because of it.</strong> The workload I once enjoyed was becoming more of a chore. Even playing with my son was becoming a strain. I finally had to tell him he couldn’t ride on daddy’s shoulders anymore.</p>
                                            <p>That little crick in my neck was suddenly a big deal.</p>
                                            <p>It really hit me how I couldn't really play with my son like I used to, but funny enough, the next day, I met an interesting guy who worked at one of the Brew Pubs. It turned out he had studied human anatomy in college, and he mentioned <strong>how sitting at my desk all day for the past 15 years was not the most ideal position for my body.</strong></p>
                                            <p>He suggested I try a neck massager. Not just any neck massager, the <a href="order.html">NeckRelax</a>! It was the name of a product he swore by.</p>

                                            <p>After a few minutes, it felt like <strong>the cold ball of tension at the base of my neck was melting away.</strong> The sensation seemed to run down the edge of my spine. Exactly what I needed at that moment.</p>
